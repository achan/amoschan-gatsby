Here's a list of software & hardware I [use on a daily
basis](https://uses.tech) as a freelance software developer.


## Editor & Terminal
* Whenever possible, I use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) + [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) in [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). Truthfully, itâ€™s been so long that I donâ€™t really remember what the benefits are. I use iTerm2 because it of the ability to move the tabs into the chrome.
* I create a separate tmux session for each project Iâ€™m working on. Each window typically has a 70/30 horizontal split with code on the top pane and a command prompt on the bottom. Iâ€™ll further split the bottom pane vertically to add live logs, tests or any other temporary data.
* For iOS development, I use Xcode ðŸ¤¯
* I use the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font in iTerm2 and Xcode because ligatures make me happy.

## Software
* I track my hours with [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com).
* I block apps from using data when tethering with [TripMode](https://www.tripmode.ch/). No, Xcode, you may not auto-upgrade while Iâ€™m on cellular data.
* I create low-fidelity wireframes with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/).

## Desk setup
* I use a three monitor layout. The monitors themselves are nothing special. Iâ€™m looking to upgrade but 1) donâ€™t want to settle for anything less than retina and 2) canâ€™t afford 2 retina monitors ðŸ’¸
* My primary monitor contains my code editor and a browser for [googling](http://duckduckgo.com).
* To my right is my [16-inch MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/ca/macbook-pro-16/). I use its retina screen to run whatever Iâ€™m coding, whether it be a web app or a mobile app.
* My left monitor contains real-time, transient data: Slack, [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/), YouTube, etc.
* The two monitors are mounted on an [AmazonBasics dual monitor arm](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00MIBN71I) and the laptop sits on a [Rain Design mStand](https://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand.html).
* I swapped out my [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) in favour of a [Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/l5v-00001) due to the negative tilt + wrist rest combo.
* [Apple Magic Trackpad 2](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRMF2LL/A/magic-trackpad-2-space-gray), no mouse.
* Everything sits atop my [78x30 Jarvis standing desk](https://www.fully.com/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-laminate.html) with a [TR-1200 DT3 under desk treadmill](https://www.lifespanfitness.com/tr1200-dt3-under-desk-treadmill) underneath it.
* **Question:** How do people sit when they have an under desk treadmill? Itâ€™s too heavy to move regularly and I always want to be at the centre of my desk. I currently move a [PRÃ„STHOLM](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/praestholm-bench-with-backrest-outdoor-gray-70418170/) over my treadmill when I want to sit. Not ideal.
